Dear [Higher Authority's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention some concerning issues related to the current work environment within our team. It has come to my notice that the project manager, [Project Manager's Name], is allegedly creating unnecessary panic and fostering a negative working atmosphere among the developers.

Several team members have expressed their concerns regarding the management approach adopted by [Project Manager's Name], suggesting that these actions may be deliberate with the intent of delaying the project. The alleged strategy appears to rely on creating a sense of urgency and stress, potentially leading to attrition, which could further contribute to project delays.

This situation is not only impacting the productivity and morale of the team but also has the potential to hinder the successful completion of the project. I believe it is crucial for the higher management to be aware of these concerns and investigate the matter to ensure a healthy and productive work environment.

I am open to discussing this matter further if needed and providing more detailed information about specific incidents. It is my sincere hope that prompt action can be taken to address these issues and maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere within the team.
